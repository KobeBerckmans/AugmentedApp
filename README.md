# Augmented Reality Object Recognition App

This iOS application combines **Augmented Reality (AR)** and **CoreML-based object recognition**. Users can interact with their surroundings through AR or select a photo from their library for object detection.

---

## Features

### ðŸŽ¥ AR Object Recognition
- Open the AR camera to detect and recognize objects in real-time.
- Identified objects are displayed as animated 3D text in the AR scene.

### ðŸ“· Photo Library Detection
- Select a photo from your library to detect and recognize the main object in the image.
- Object names are displayed for the selected photo.

### âœ¨ User-Friendly Start Screen
- A clean and interactive start screen with buttons to access the AR camera or the photo library.

## Requirements

- **iOS 15.0+**
- Xcode 15.2 or higher
- A device with ARKit support

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ar-object-recognition.git
open AugmentedApp.xcodeproj

Make sure the deployment target is set to a compatible device.
Run the app on a physical device (ARKit does not work on the simulator).

Configuration
Permissions
Ensure the app has the necessary permissions in the Info.plist file:

For AR camera access:
xml
Copy code
NSCameraUsageDescription
This app requires camera access for AR functionality.</
For Photo Library access:
xml
Copy code
NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription
This app requires access to your photo library to analyze images.

How It Works
AR Camera:

Tap "Open Camera" on the start screen.
Point your camera at objects to recognize them.
The app uses Vision and CoreML to detect objects and display their names in AR.
Photo Library:


## Technlogies used
Swift: Primary programming language
ARKit: For creating AR experiences
Vision: For image recognition
CoreML: Using the MobileNetV2 model for object detection
SwiftUI: For the start screen interface
## Known Issues
AR object detection accuracy depends on lighting and object clarity.
Photo Library recognition may not work well with cluttered images or unsupported objects.
## Future Improvements

Add support for custom CoreML models.
Enhance AR animations for better user feedback.
Allow saving recognized objects to a database.

## How it works 
AR Object Recognition:

Tap "Open Camera" on the start screen to launch the AR experience.
Point your device's camera at objects in the environment.
The app uses ARKit to track objects and CoreML to recognize them.
Recognized objects are displayed in the AR view as 3D text labels showing their names.
Photo Library Object Detection:

Tap "Open Photo Library" on the start screen to select a photo.
The app processes the photo using CoreML and Vision to detect objects.
Once the object is recognized, the name of the detected object is displayed on the screen.

## Technologies Used
Swift: The primary programming language for the app.
ARKit: To create immersive AR experiences and handle AR camera input.
CoreML: Used for object detection via a trained model.
Vision: Used for processing and analyzing images for object recognition.
RealityKit: Provides the framework for creating and animating 3D content in AR.
UIKit: Used to build the app's interface.

## Custom Models
This app uses the MobileNetV2 model for object detection. You can replace this model with another custom model if needed. The app processes both real-time camera input and selected images from the user's library using this model.

## Troubleshooting
AR functionality not working on Simulator: ARKit only works on physical devices. Please test on a real iPhone or iPad.
Photo Library Access: Ensure that the app has permission to access the photo library in Info.plist and check device privacy settings.
Object Recognition not accurate: If the model does not recognize certain objects well, consider training a custom CoreML model for your use case.
